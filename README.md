1. Fork this repository [[https://github.com/zigyprints/appDevelopmentApplications]].
2. Create a branch with your name (e.g., "yourname_assignment").
3. Commit your code as you progress with meaningful commit messages.
4. Once completed, create a pull request from your branch to the main repository (replace "main repository" with the original repository URL).
5. Include a README.md file explaining your approach, challenges faced, and any additional features or improvements you might have added if given more time.

MY EDIT : 
- I faced issues including to add the image selector option, so I skipped it.
- The process of learing to use the Gesture Detector widget this way was quite rewarding.
