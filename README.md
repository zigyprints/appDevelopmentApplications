Assignment for Internship Shortlisting:

Title: Flutter 2D Editing Canvas

Duration: 1 week

Objective: The objective of this assignment is to assess the candidates' proficiency in Flutter development, specifically in creating a 2D editing canvas. The canvas should support basic functionalities like drawing shapes, selecting colors, and importing images.

Features achieved:
- Canvas where the user can doodle using hand gestures.
- User can choose custom color to doodle, achieved using flutter_colorpicker.
- used provider package for state management
- implemented add image from library using image_picker and the user can doodle on the selected image also.
- Implement a bottom navigation bar for easy access of the features of the app.

Extra features:
- added partially working undo and redo feature

Things that could have better if I had extra time:
- I could have worked on erase functionality in a much more efficient way

problems faced during development:
- I couldn't properly write the logic of erase feature. If the user clicks on erase the whole canvas gets wiped off.
- I couldn't write the whole logic for undo and redo functionality.
