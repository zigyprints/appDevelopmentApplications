# Editing Canvas
I was able to implement most functionalities of what were required. I faced into issues while working with the image cropper and especially while building the logic for the touch gestures in the app.

Challenges:
Implementing accurate touch gesture detection.
Integrating the image_cropper package and overlaying it on the UI.
State management and Shared preferences package.
